# A1-Dictionary

A1-Dictionary is an Android application developed using Kotlin that serves as a dictionary tool. It implements various modern Android development concepts such as ViewBinding, Retrofit, Coroutines, LiveData, ViewModel, Room, Gson, KSP, and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.

## Demo

## Features

- **Search for Words**: Users can search for words and get their meanings from an API.
- **Store Words**: Users can store words and their meanings in a local database (Room).
- **Delete Words**: Users can delete stored words from the local database.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **ViewBinding**: Utilized for view binding to improve performance and eliminate findViewById calls.
- **Retrofit**: Used for networking to fetch word meanings from an API.
- **Coroutines**: Employed for asynchronous programming to handle API requests.
- **LiveData**: Used for data observation and update in the UI.
- **ViewModel**: Used for managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Room**: Used for local database storage of words and meanings.
- **Gson**: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)**: Used for generating code to simplify Room database interactions.

## MVVM Architecture

A1-Dictionary follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which helps in separating the UI logic from the business logic. The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the View (UI) and the Model (data).
